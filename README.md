# Lab19-CreateAnAPI

Create an API.

## Challenge

Starting from an empty MVC template, create an API that allows a user to create individual ToDo tasks, and put them in a ToDoList. 
This API in .NET Core should conduct the standard HTTP verbs (Get,Put,Post,Delete) for a “To-Do” list.

The “To-Do” list will consist of individual tasks that can be saved into the database and extracted as needed. A user has the ability to get all of the tasks by a simple get request. 

## Solution
